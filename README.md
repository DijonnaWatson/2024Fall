So far I’ve taken Computer Science 1-3, Computer Architecture, and Object Oriented Programming. 
While I haven’t done much with web programming, I’ve made a soundboard and weather webpage through tutorials. Although my experience is limited, 
these projects helped me learn a decent amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Last semester there was an interesting GUI assignment that we did and 
it was to make an application where the user can choose between three different shapes and change their color and size. 
Even though we weren’t taught much about GUI development in class, it was interesting to play around and see what worked. 
One of the coolest projects I recently collaborated on was helping build a quantum computer over the summer using optics and optical components. 
It was exciting to start with little knowledge of quantum computing and then come out of this project with a fairly good concept at the time. 
Along the way, I also learned some Python and linear algebra, which added to the experience. 

I’m looking forward to taking web programming because I’m excited about the opportunity to develop a personal project throughout the semester.
This kind of hands-on experience is where I thrive and learn the most, and I anticipate using the step-by-step approach we practice here in future projects,
applying the skills and concepts from this course to new challenges.
